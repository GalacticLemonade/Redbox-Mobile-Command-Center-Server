# Redbox Mobile Command Center Server
Kiosk backend for the [tablet](https://github.com/GalacticLemonade/Redbox-Mobile-Command-Center)!
<br><br>
I will be using this, paired with a custom-made tablet powered via a Raspberry Pi (or a jail-broken surface rt), to manage my Redbox kiosks.

I took inspiration from Puyodead1's [message](https://discord.com/channels/1292310422749319209/1292310423366012990/1328506669499416706) in the Redbox Tinkering discord.
